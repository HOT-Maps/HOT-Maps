We've added a mandatory testing stage in the tutorial that all users must attempt before freely editing and modifying the existing map.
* The stage consists of multiple mapping tasks such as house outlining and road tracing.
  * This stage can be found under modules/ui/intro/testYourself.js 
* Using our custom metrics, we evaluate the accuracy of the user's shapes and lines against the ground-truth existing maps.
   * Accessible via the similarityScore and roadScore functions in modules/ui/intro/helper.js
* Users have a finite number of *lives* that keep track of the number of mistakes, only granting full editing permissions to users who make four mistakes or fewer.

## iD Basics

* iD is a JavaScript [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) editor.
* It's intentionally simple. It lets you do the most basic tasks while not breaking other people's data.
* It supports all popular modern desktop browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge.
* iD is not yet designed for mobile browsers, but this is something we hope to add!
* Data is rendered with [d3.js](https://d3js.org/).

## Installation

To run the current development version of iD on your own computer:

#### Cloning the repository

The repository is reasonably large, and it's unlikely that you need the full history (~200 MB). If you are happy to wait for it all to download, run:

```
git clone https://github.com/ChrisG777/OSM_game.git
```

To clone only the most recent version, instead use a 'shallow clone':

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ChrisG777/OSM_game.git
```

If you want to add in the full history later on, perhaps to run `git blame` or `git log`, run `git fetch --depth=1000000`

#### Building iD

1. `cd` into the newly cloned project folder
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run all`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` in a web browser

For guidance on building a packaged version, running tests, and contributing to
development, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
